# Weather Android App
In this application, I have used very common and important element of Android development: downloading data from the Internet! I am requesting weather forecast data from a free API provided by darksky.net. Then parsing that data (in JSON format) and display it in a single-page app. I have also handled errors and situations when the network is unavailable.

# Tool and Technologies
  - Networking
  - OkHttp
  - Using an API
  - Parsing JSON
  - Using a DialogFragment
